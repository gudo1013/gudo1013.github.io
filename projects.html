                    Eagle Scout Project<br>
                    For my Eagle Scout Project, I built three 'carpetball' tables for a local summer camp called Catholic Youth Camp at the <a href="https://stmcenter.com/" target="_blank">St. Thomas More Center</a>.
                    Each summer, over 1400 kids and young adults will come and spend a week at this camp, learning about faith and having a ton of fun.
                    I have been attending CYC ever since I was in third grade and decided that I wanted to give back by building three new tables. 
                    I held a fundraiser for the money to buy the supplies and had volunteers help assemble the tables in my garage. I had the
                    opportunity to work over the summer of 2021 at CYC and saw how much joy these kids were getting out of the tables so it was all worth it.

                    In one of my economics courses, Econometrics, I had the opportunity to research a topic and perform some tests to determine how statistically likely something is.
                    My partner, Colby Flynn, and I chose to look at the NBA; more specifically on various factors that contribute to an individual team's win percentage as well
                    as the competitive imbalance that the league was experiencing at the time.
                    We concluded that teams with more all-star players on their roster or teams that accur the luxury tax for having such players tend to have a higher win percentage than those who don't.
                    This was summed up in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqWpZzznE1ifmvDlKa8yDvTxIToOhOk_KxT-3rkZ7GU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">paper</a> that we collaborated on.
